    <p><b>What is JSmooth ?</b></p>
        <p>JSmooth is a '.exe' wrapper, that easies the pain of launching a Java application on Windows.
        It builds standard Windows executable binaries (.exe) that contain all the information needed
        to launch your Java application, i.e. the classpath, the Java properties, the JVM version required,
        and so on. If Java is not installed, it helps the users by displaying them a notice before
        launching automatically a browser to a web site where they can download a JVM.</p>
    <p><b>Project status</b></p>
        <p>JSmooth is currently in beta phase. It is provided in the hope it can be useful to the Java community,
        but always keep in mind that it's still beta.</p>
